# 3DModelling
For the following course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-models-virtual-reality?specialization=virtual-reality

My scene has trees, rocks and some grass arranged to form a forest clearing. To use the scene you should have an android phone with API 19 or higher that can run cardboard. Also Unity 2018.4.19f1 has been used to make this application so that should be used to run it. Once you open the project, open MyScene from Assets>Scenes, add it in build settings and build and run it for android with your phone connected to the computer. If you want to run it on something else besides cardboard you can change the settings in the player.
